# Java-Social-Network
A social network software purely built using Java.
In the social network, there are a set of nodes. Each node can be of type: individual, group, business,
or organisation. All nodes have a unique id (int), a set of links to other nodes, a name (String), a
creation date, and a set of uploaded or posted content. A content can be implemented as a string
object, which can be reposted multiple times without duplication. Individuals can optionally have
birthdays in addition to all the node attributes. Businesses and organisations have location (2D
coordinates) in addition to all node attributes. Groups and organisations can have linked
individuals as members. Businesses can have individuals as owners or customers. Businesses can
also be members of groups. No other forms of links are allowed, e.g. a business cannot be owner
of another business, or a group cannot be a member of an organisation.

There exists the following functionalities:
1. Create and delete nodes of each type.
2. Search for nodes using the name or type or birthday. 
3. Print all linked nodes to a given input node. 
4. Create and post content by a user. 
5. Search for content posted by any node. 
6. Display all content posted by nodes linked to a given node. 
7. A master text-based interface to print all nodes in the system and utilize all the above
functionalities.

ENJOY THE SOCIAL NETWORK!!
